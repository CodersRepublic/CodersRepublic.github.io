                    <br><h4>A partial lunar eclipse will occur on November 19 and will be visible from extreme north-eastern parts of Arunachal Pradesh and Assam. It'll begin at 12 hours 48 minutes IST and end at 16 hours 17 minutes . It'll be the longest partial lunar eclipse in 580 years, said Dr Debiprosad Duari, Director, Research & Academic at MP Birla Planetarium. So what exactly is a lunar eclipse? A lunar eclipse occurs when the Moon moves into the Earth's shadow This can occur only when the Sun, Earth, and Moon are exactly or very closely aligned with Earth between the other two, and only on the night of a full moon. The type and length of a lunar eclipse depend on the Moon's proximity to either node of its orbit. A totally eclipsed Moon is sometimes called a blood moon for its reddish color, which is caused by Earth completely blocking direct sunlight from reaching the Moon. The only light reflected from the lunar surface has been refracted by Earth's atmosphere. This light appears reddish for the same reason that a sunset or sunrise does: the Rayleigh scattering of bluer light. Unlike a solar eclipse, which can only be viewed from a relatively small area of the world, a lunar eclipse may be viewed from anywhere on the night side of Earth. A total lunar eclipse can last up to nearly 2 hours, while a total solar eclipse lasts only up to a few minutes at any given place, because the Moon's shadow is smaller. Also unlike solar eclipses, lunar eclipses are safe to view without any eye protection or special precautions, as they are dimmer than the full Moon.</h4>
