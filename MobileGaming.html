                    <br><h4>Monetisation is at a very nascent stage in Indiaâ€™s $1.5-billion mobile gaming sector but it shows the potential to reach $5 billion by 2025, according to a recent study.
                            An average mobile gamer in India spent $3-10 in 2020, as compared to $57-66 spent by a mobile gamer in China and $73-77 by a gamer in the United States, said the report by Sequoia India and the Boston Consulting Group. This does not include real-money gaming (RMG) spends and was adjusted for purchasing power parity for 2020.
                            The report noted that there is a massive growth opportunity in the sector in India, since only 46 percent of Indians were connected to the internet in 2020, as against 60 percent in China and 89 percent in the US. Also, only 22 percent of the population has played at least one mobile game as of 2020, compared with 45 percent in China and 52 percent in the US.
